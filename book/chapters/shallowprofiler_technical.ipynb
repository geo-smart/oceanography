    "# Shallow Profiler: Technical\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the technical back-story for the `shallowprofiler` notebook. Here is a broad outline; \n",
    "with the idea of keeping the main data-driven narrative less cluttered.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are three sites that support shallow profilers\n",
    "- Each site has a platform tethered at 200 meters depth\n",
    "- Each platform has a winch that (nine times daily) allows the profiler to rise to near the surface and descend again\n",
    "- As a result we have sensor profiles from the instruments affixed to the profiler\n",
    "- We have pressure / depth data as well so we can produce profile charts\n",
    "    - These have depth as the vertical access and sensor reading on the horizontal axis\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "To further reduce clutter there are Python modules available as well: `shallowprofiler.py` and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the imported `shallowprofiler.py` module we have available `sensors`: A list of lists. \n",
    "Each entry is `[sensor_name, instrument_name]` so for example `sensors[4]` is `['temperature', 'ctd']`.\n",
    "To see the entirety: `sensors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The data volume across many sensors get fairly large. There are multiple ways to approach\n",
    "not bogging down the Jupyter/IPython environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Work at full time resolution in a narrow time window (e.g. one month)\n",
    "- Work at a reduced time resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "With instrument and sensor names sorted (with spectral irradiance a special case) the next step\n",
    "is to build a data dictionary called **`d `** with keys corresponding to sensor (data) types:\n",
    "**`conductivity`, `temperature`, `pco2`** etcetera. The corresponding value for each sensor\n",
    "key is a five-tuple indexed \\[0\\], \\[1\\], ..., \\[4\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0: XArray DataArray: sensor data\n",
    "1: XArray DataArray: sensor depth (meters, negative down) corresponding to data\n",
    "2: float: Default charting lower limit for data\n",
    "3: float: Default charting upper limit for data\n",
    "4: string: Default chart color e.g. \"blue\"\n",

    "In order to generate these we need to know when the profiler is starting and ending \n",
    "an ascent; as well as a descent and a rest period when it is parked on the platform\n",
    "at 200 meters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Profile metadata is read using the function `ReadProfileMetadata(filename)` where the filename\n",
    "describes the site and the time period of interest. The data are held in a pandas Dataframe.\n",

    "The data structure `sensors` is a list of 2-element lists. The first element is a sensor name\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
