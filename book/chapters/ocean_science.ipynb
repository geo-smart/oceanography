    "### The *epipelagic ocean* defined\n",
    "\n",
    "Before tackling what is meant by *stability*\n",
    "let us define the term 'epipelagic ocean'. *Epipelagic* is more or\n",
    "less synomymous with *sunlit* or *photic* and it is applied as a modifier to *zone*. \n",
    "That is, the upper 200 meter layer of the water column is the epipelagic zone; \n",
    "this being the maximal depth of downwelling sunlight, which is in turn the \n",
    "energy source for primary production. We are considering the ecosystem occupied \n",
    "primarily by phytoplankton in the upper ocean, an engine that powers the food\n",
    "web by converting solar energy to chemical energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving from *epipelagic zone* to *epipelagic ocean*: The epipelagic zone changes in \n",
    "nature from one place to another; so how stable is it *everywhere*? Alas we have as \n",
    "our observational starting point a mere three observing sites, located fairly close \n",
    "to one another in the northeast Pacific. The good news is that each\n",
    "of these sites gathers an unprecedented amount of data by means of \"shallow profiler\"\n",
    "sensing platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limits on observation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Placing shallow profilers in vast quantities would be prohibitively expensive.\n",
    "Working with three of them however puts us in a position to comment on *stability* in \n",
    "two ways. First we will have the state of the upper ocean in unprecedented fine-scale.\n",
    "Second we hope to identify key features of the water column that might be amenable to other \n",
    "sensor programs, particularly ARGO drifters and satellite remote sensing of the sea surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The meaning of *stability*. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stability is not a simple reifiable value. Here we define it very broadly.\n",
    "A list of interpretive stability parameters and dimensions includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- depth dimension: Through the upper 200 meters on scales of centimeters to tens of meters\n",
    "- physical stability: temperature, density of water, available light\n",
    "- chemical stability: salinity, dissolved oxygen, inorganic carbon\n",
    "- biological stability: nutrient concentration (nitrates), particulate distribution, fluorescence, ...\n",
    "- lateral structure, scales from meters to mesoscale (hundreds of kilometers)\n",
    "- time scales: minutes to days to seasonal to annual to multi-year climatology\n",
    "- perturbation in relation to larger phenomena\n",
    "    - sea state, storms, temperature, upwelling, eddies, currents, terrigenous influence (runoff)\n",
    "- perturbation in relation to small phenomena such as plankton lensing\n",
    "- stability of stratified sub-structure\n",
    "    - mixed layer depth, multiple clines (barocline, thermocline etcetera), lower epipelagic\n",
    "- intrinsic signal consistency, for example presence/absence of inversion layers\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "From an empirical perspective these dimensions of stability can in many cases be seen as\n",
    "forms of standard deviation. But that is looking ahead to strategy. \n",
    "Hopefully by defining *stability* in this wide multidimensional sense we are open to\n",
    "a great deal of interest in the *structure* of the upper ocean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The utility of *coincidence*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Coincidence* here refers to data structure that is present in multiple sensor streams. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The water column is well understood to be stratified. The upper layer is\n",
    "the *mixed layer*, below that is a transitional layer, and below this is the upper \n",
    "part of the *pelagic layer* which constitutes the bulk of the water column. In this \n",
    "work we can begin with a null hypothesis that the sensor data will show these \n",
    "three strata with repeatable consistency. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortly we commence looking at depth charts that show the epipelagic depth on the vertical axis\n",
    "and one or more sensor parameters on the horizontal. Such a chart is informally referred to as \n",
    "a profile. Two things are readily apparent in profiles: First they tend to have a consistent\n",
    "shape, and second that they occasionally exhibit anomalous structure. Anomalies are interesting\n",
    "for a single sensor type say like temperature. However an anomaly that is present and persistent \n",
    "across multiple sensor types (say temperature, salinity and Chlorophyll-A fluorescence) is\n",
    "indicating ocean structure on some physical and temporal scale. "

    "- The ocean is illuminated from above by sunlight that penetrates\n",
    "to a depth of about 200 meters\n",
    "    - Beneath this upper layer the ocean is always dark, regardless of time of day\n",
    "- The upper 200 meters of the ocean is the *photic zone*\n",
    "    - Sunlight is available as an energy source\n",
    "    - Phytoplankton ('plant-like plankton') make use of this energy\n",
    "        - They are the base level of the food web\n",
    "    - Phytoplankton use available chemicals and sunlight to store energy\n",
